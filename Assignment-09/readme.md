Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
Universal Selector is used to edit t he style of every element on the page. It uses a star or asterisk to denote "all".
Element Selector is used for each specific element. Such as if we want every heading or paragraph to be one color or have the same border, we would use the element selector.
Class Selector would be used to select specific elements. Such as different paragraphs or sections on the page.
ID Selector is similar to class selector where each section has their own "ID" and that is how they are edited. Unlike Class Selectors which start with ".", ID Selectors start with "#" to denote the beginning.
