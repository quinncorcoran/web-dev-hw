## Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?
For this assignment I chose the fonts "always forever" for the heading and "hammer keys" for the body. I chose them because I thought that they had a sort of old timey typed/handwritten feel. However, after I added the button at the bottom of my page, neither of the fonts would show up in the browser and despite my best efforts, I have not been able to get them back up again.


##  What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
System fonts are those already installed on your device, web fonts are custom fonts that are hosted on a server, and web-safe fonts are fonts that are available and will show up pretty much anywhere. Its important to have a web-safe font as your fallback, just in case you are using a system or web font that is not supported by all devices and systems.


## My Work Cycle
I started out fairly confident in this assignment, but as I began to add more things in the style sheet, I had various problems, such as my index connecting to things from my previous file sheet, and some size and font issues. Both of my fonts were showing up until I added the "read more" button, and then they went away and were replaced by a fallback font and I have been unable to fix it. I am feeling frustrated by this assignment and the last one, but hoping to do better on the final project.
