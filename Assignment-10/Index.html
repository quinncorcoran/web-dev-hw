      <p>The Raven
        <br>
          Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
      Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
      While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
      As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
      "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-
                       Only this, and nothing more."

      Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
      And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
      Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
      From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
      For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
                       Nameless here for evermore.

   <p>"And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
                 This it is, and nothing more." </p>
