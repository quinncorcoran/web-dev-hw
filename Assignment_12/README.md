Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
  My Client is pretty much anyone who wants to come over and just like vibe. Like literally just vibe. There's a pizza in the oven if they are like hungry.  

What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
  they are different because in display block you can use as a block element when spacing,
  but however, display inline lets elements be displayed next to each other like a line,
  and block inline allows the blocks to be displayed in a line. I've most often had to
  use display block inline.
